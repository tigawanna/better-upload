  This update removes the AWS SDK and uses `aws4fetch`, improving performance and reducing bundle size. There are also some changes to provide a better developer experience.

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### New package

  The `better-upload` package has been split into separate packages. The server package is now available at `@better-upload/server`.

  ```bash
  npm remove better-upload @aws-sdk/client-s3
  npm install @better-upload/server
  ```

  ### S3 clients

  Client helpers from `better-upload/server/helpers` have been removed. Clients are now exported from `@better-upload/server/clients`.

  Here's how to update your router code:

  ```ts
  import { Router } from '@better-upload/server';
  import { aws } from '@better-upload/server/clients';

  const router: Router = {
    client: aws(), // or cloudflare(), backblaze(), tigris(), ...,
    bucketName: 'my-bucket',
    routes: {
      // ...
    },
  };
  ```

  As the AWS SDK was removed, you cannot use `new S3Client()` anymore. Instead, use the [pre-built clients](https://better-upload.com/docs/helpers-server#s3-clients) for popular services, or the `custom()` client for any S3-compatible service:

  ```ts
  import { custom } from '@better-upload/server/clients';

  // example for AWS S3, even though you should use aws()
  const s3 = custom({
    hostname: 's3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com',
    accessKeyId: '...',
    secretAccessKey: '...',
    region: 'us-east-1',
    secure: true,
    forcePathStyle: false,
  });
  ```

  #### How to do S3 operations now

  You can now use helpers provided by `@better-upload/server/helpers` to perform some common S3 operations previously done with the AWS SDK. [Learn more in the docs.](https://better-upload.com/docs/helpers-server#objects)

  ### Move object helper

  The `moveObject` helper has been updated to be more flexible.

  ```ts
  import { aws } from '@better-upload/server/clients';
  import { moveObject } from '@better-upload/server/helpers';

  await moveObject(aws(), {
    source: {
      bucket: 'source-bucket',
      key: 'example.png',
    },
    destination: {
      bucket: 'destination-bucket',
      key: 'copy.png',
    },
  });
  ```

  ### Object info

  Now, where previously only `objectKey` was available, the full `objectInfo` is provided, which includes the object `key`, `metadata`, `acl`, `storageClass`, and `cacheControl`.

  Here's an example of where it's used:

  ```ts
  const router: Router = {
    client: aws(),
    bucketName: 'my-bucket',
    routes: {
      demo: route({
        onBeforeUpload: ({ file }) => {
          // file.objectInfo is NOT available here

          return {
            objectInfo: {
              key: `uploads/${file.name}`,
              metadata: {},
            },
          };
        },

        onAfterSignedUrl: ({ file }) => {
          console.log(file.objectInfo); // full objectInfo is available here
        },
      }),
    },
  };
  ```

  ### Next.js Route Handler

  The `createUploadRouteHandler` function has been renamed to `toRouteHandler` and is now exported from `@better-upload/server/adapters/next`.

  ```ts
  import { Router } from '@better-upload/server';
  import { toRouteHandler } from '@better-upload/server/adapters/next';

  const router: Router = {
    // ...
  };

  export const { POST } = toRouteHandler(router);
  ```
