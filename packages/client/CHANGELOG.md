  ## Breaking Changes

  ### New package

  The `better-upload` package has been split into separate packages. Everything exported from `better-upload/client` is now available at `@better-upload/client`.

  ```bash
  npm remove better-upload
  npm install @better-upload/client
  ```

  ### Object info

  `objectKey` has been removed from `FileUploadInfo` and replaced with `objectInfo`, which contains more information about the S3 object, such as `key`, `metadata`, and `cacheControl`.

  `objectInfo` is now present on all instances where you would previously find `objectKey`. Here's an example of how to update your code:

  Before:

  ```tsx
  useUploadFile({
    route: 'demo',
    onUploadComplete: ({ file }) => {
      console.log(file.objectKey);
      // object metadata and cacheControl are missing
    },
  });
  ```

  After:

  ```tsx
  useUploadFile({
    route: 'demo',
    onUploadComplete: ({ file }) => {
      console.log(file.objectInfo.key);
      // there is also .metadata and .cacheControl
    },
  });
  ```
